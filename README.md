# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis

Hi there! 👋  
This project dives into one of the most famous datasets out there — the Titanic passenger list — to explore **who had the best chances of survival** and why. It’s a great mix of data cleaning, visualization, and a bit of storytelling with Python!

## 🔍 What’s This Project About?

Using data from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), this notebook-based project helps answer questions like:

- Did women and children really get saved first?
- Did your ticket class or the port you boarded from affect your chances?
- What role did age or traveling with family play?

---

## 📁 What's Inside?

- **`Charts.ipynb`** – The main Jupyter Notebook with all the code, analysis, and visuals.
- **`Titanic-Dataset.csv`** – The raw dataset we’re working with.  
- *(More files may be added as the project evolves!)*

## 🛠 How to Run It

To explore the notebook yourself:

## 🧪 What We Did
Here’s a quick look at the steps we took:

Loaded the data and got a feel for what we’re working with.

Cleaned up missing or irrelevant info (like dropping ticket numbers and filling in missing ages).

Created new insights, like calculating family size.

Visualized the data using plots, graphs, and heatmaps.

Analyzed survival patterns based on gender, class, age groups, embarkation points, and family size.

## 📊 Some Key Insights
Gender mattered: Women had much higher survival rates than men.

Class played a big role: First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Traveling with family might’ve helped (but not always).

Port of boarding affected survival rates — some ports had more survivors.

Younger passengers generally had better chances.
